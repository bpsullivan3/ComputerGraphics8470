     Lab #2: DDA Rasterizer
  </h1>

<p></p>
<i> Credit: Based on notes from Sara Mathieson</i>

<p></p>
Rasterizing lines is one of many fundamental topics in a graphics course. The goal of this lab is to implement and test a simple DDA rasterizer. For labs, feel free to compare code and share ideas. Also make sure that others around you are making progress.


<h3>Step 1: Download the starter code</h3>

Download <a href="lab2.html">lab2.html</a> (right-click on this link and then choose "Save As"). Open this file in Sublime (or your preferred editor). This file contains some boiler-plate code and two methods that you'll implement.

<p></p>

<h3>Step 2: The drawLine Function</h3>

  Implement the function <code>drawLine</code> using the DDA rasterization algorithm described in class. Note that this function takes in five arguments in this order: the (x,y) coordinates of the first point, the (x, y) coordinates of the second endpoint, and the line color.   

  <p></p>
  Your method should not use any built-in line drawing functions. Instead, your method should color individual pixels using the <code>setPixel</code> function from your starter code. 

<!--  <pre>    <font color=blue>graphics.fillRect(x,y,1,1)</font> <font color=green>// fill a 1x1 rectangle with an upper-left corner at (x,y)</pre></font> -->

  <p></p> 
  This page of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">HTML Color Names</a> is useful for pre-defined colors.

  <h3>Step 3: Testing</h3>

  As you are implementing the <code>drawLine</code> method, make sure to test it out by calling it from the <code>draw</code> method. Your <code>draw</code> method will end up consisting of several calls to your <code>drawLine</code> method. Test it out on lines of various slopes and sizes. Here are some examples:
  <pre>    drawLineFast(50, 300, 350, 100, "magenta", 1);  // slope < 1 
    drawLineFast(350, 100, 50, 300, "purple", 1);   // switch points; code should still work
    drawLineFast(200, 80, 100, 380, "red", 1);      // slope > 1     
    drawLineFast(50, 200, 350, 200, "green", 1);    // slope = 0
    drawLineFast(250, 50, 250, 350, "blue", 1);     // slope = &#x221e; </pre>
  
  These calls should produce an image similar to the one below:
  <p></p>
  <center>
  <img src="test.png" width=300px alt="example"/>
  </center>

  <h3>Step 4: Canvas Grid</h3>

  Now that your <code>drawLine</code> function works, let's draw something on the canvas. We'll start by filling the canvas with a grid pattern (which we may use in the next step).

  <p></p>
  Comment out the code from the previous step. Inside the function <code>draw</code>, write two independent <code>for</code> loops that create a grid that covers the entire canvas (using calls to the <code>drawLine</code> method). The example below shows a 10x10 lightgrey grid on a 400x400 canvas (so each grid cell is 40x40 pixels). You may choose any grid size or color you want. 

  <p></p>
  <center>
  <img src="grid.png" width=300px alt="example"/>
  </center>

  <h3>Step 5: Snowflake</h3>
  Finally, draw a snowflake or another shape that uses lines with different slopes. Here is an example:

  <p></p>
  <center>
  <img src="snowflake.png" width=300px alt="example"/>
  </center>

  <p></p>

  Again, you may only use calls to the <code>drawLine</code> method. You may find the grid useful in figuring out endpoint coordinates.
 <p>

  <!--As another test, try out a line with endpoints (50,350) and (75,50). It might not look very good. Why is that? Modify your line algorithm to account for cases like this. -->


  <h3>Step 6: Extras</h3>

  <p></p>

  (Note: not for extra credit this time, just for more practice with JavaScript functions and HTML canvas.) <p> 

  <ul>
    <li> 
      Experiment with your shape: different pattern, different color, different size.
    </li>

    <li> 
      Augment your line drawing method to include a line width argument.
    </li>

    <li> 
      Going further: <i> automate </i> your snowflake drawing in a separate method, maybe something that takes as arguments the center position of the snowflake and/or the radius. Use this method to draw multiple snowflakes or randomly positioned snowflakes. You may need a finer grid for this step, or no grid at all.  
    </li>
  </ul>

<p></p>
You do not have to turn this lab in, but you are welcome to email me your image (take a screenshot and save as a <code>.png</code> file). Throughout the semester I'll often demo examples of excellent student work. If you prefer I not show your work, please let me know.
